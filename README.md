<h2>Pet's Appreciation Site</h2>
  <p>I created this project with the objective of practicing html, css and java script. The site is still not responsive to small screens but updates will be made to achieve this objective. The site has 2 galleries with a scroll bar, images and a list with links.</p>
  
[One of the tutorials that helped me learn html, css and java script to create the page was the videos by 'Curso em video'](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrWvhVmt0Qac3HgsjQK62FQ).
